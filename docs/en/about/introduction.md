> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pumpkin is currently under heavy development. Check out our [Github Project](https://github.com/orgs/Pumpkin-MC/projects/3) to see current progress.

## Vanilla

Pumpkin is designed to replicate Vanilla Minecraft logic as closely as possible,
ensuring a familiar gameplay experience. However, we've also added new features to enhance gameplay.

## Redstone

Unlike other forks that may compromise redstone mechanics, Pumpkin maintains the Vanilla redstone behavior.
If you're looking to experiment with redstone modifications or seek performance optimizations, you have the flexibility to do so through our configurable settings.
