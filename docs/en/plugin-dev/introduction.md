# Pumpkin Plugin Development
::: warning
The Pumpkin Plugin API is still in a very early stage of development and may change at any time.
If you run into any issues please reach out on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/aaNuD6rFEe).
:::

Pumpkin Plugins integrate with the server software on a very deep level allowing for many things that would not be possible on other server software.

The Pumpkin Plugin API takes inspiration from the Spigot/Bukkit plugin API in many places, so if you have previous experience with these and have experience with Rust development, you should have a pretty easy time writing plugins for Pumpkin. :smile:
